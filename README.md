# 🧠 From Finite Loops to Infinite Tapes

A visual walkthrough of how a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** can evolve into a fully-fledged **Turing Machine Simulator**. This documentation is perfect for anyone curious about **Theory of Computation**, from students to enthusiasts and educators.

## 🚀 Live Demo

🎮 Try the simulator in your browser:  
👉 [Turing Machine Simulator – Live Demo](https://lemueljay.github.io/turing_machine_simulator/)

---

## 🧪 Example Inputs

🔍 Curious how to get started? Example demo inputs can be found in the [`demo/`](https://github.com/lemueljay/turing_machine_simulator/tree/main/demo) folder.
These include sample JSON configurations you can load into the simulator to see predefined state transitions in action.
Will add more as I iterate further.

---

## 🕹️ How to Use the Demo

1. **Copy** one of the sample JSONs from the [`demo/`](./demo/) folder.
2. **Paste** it into the simulator’s JSON input box.
3. Click **`Init`** to load the machine.
4. Press **`Play`** to run the simulation automatically, or **`Step`** to run it one transition at a time.
5. You can **change the input string** anytime and click **`Init`** again to restart the simulation with the new input.
