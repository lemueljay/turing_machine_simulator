# 🧠 From Finite Loops to Infinite Tapes

A visual walkthrough of how a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** can evolve into a fully-fledged **Turing Machine Simulator**. This documentation is perfect for anyone curious about **Theory of Computation**, from students to enthusiasts and educators.

## 🚀 Live Demo

🎮 Try the simulator in your browser:  
👉 [Turing Machine Simulator – Live Demo](https://lemueljay.github.io/turing_machine_simulator/)

## 🧪 Example Inputs

🔍 Curious how to get started? Example demo inputs can be found in the [`demo/`](https://github.com/lemueljay/turing_machine_simulator/tree/main/demo) folder.
These include sample JSON configurations you can load into the simulator to see predefined state transitions in action.
Will add more as I iterate further.
